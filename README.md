# Knowledge_Graph_X_LLM

Knowledge_Graph_X_LLM is a toolkit for generating, managing, and visualizing knowledge graphs (KG) using Large Language Models (LLMs). This project provides an end-to-end pipeline for extracting structured knowledge from unstructured text, managing the resulting knowledge graph, and visualizing it interactively.

## Features

- **Knowledge Graph Generation**: Automatically extract entities and relationships from text using LLMs.
- **Knowledge Graph Management**: Store, update, and query knowledge graphs efficiently.
- **Visualization**: Interactive visualization tools for exploring and analyzing the knowledge graph.
- **Service APIs**: Expose KG operations via RESTful APIs for integration with other applications.
